# HotelCrud5

This project represents a comprehensive study endeavor where I developed an Angular application for Hotel Reservation Management. Serving as an initial exploration into Angular, this application showcases my ability to design and implement solutions in a simplified manner. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in creating a functional system for managing hotel reservations, highlighting my proficiency in Angular development.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages.
